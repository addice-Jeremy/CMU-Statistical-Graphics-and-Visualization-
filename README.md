# Course & Project Overview:

### Instructor: Raja Sooriamurthi

Graphical displays of quantitative information take on many forms as they help us understand both data and models. This course will serve to introduce the student to the most common forms of graphical displays and their uses and misuses. Students will learn both how to create these displays and how to understand them. As time permits, the course will consider some more advanced graphical methods such as interactive graphics, computer-generated animations, maps, network graphics, etc. Each student will be required to engage in projects using graphical methods to understand data collected from a real scientific or engineering experiment.

# Introduction - Why Workers Quit

Employees are the backbone of any organization. The success of an organization is heavily dependent on committed employees who are motivated and productive to carry out a company's goals and objectives. Thus, employee attrition, the rate at which employees leave their job, hurts the growth and performance of an organization in terms of financial profit, productivity, and time. However, attrition is an inevitable part of any business. There will come a time when an employees wants to leave a company, which can happen for many reasons. For instance, employees might be seeking for better opportunities, mentally illed, working excessive hours, working in a toxic atmosphere or under bad management, etc. But when attrition reaches a particular threshold, it becomes a concern to be addressed as it may be reflecting a deep problem with the company culture. Attrition is particularly concerning when the attrition rate is high, indicating that employees are turning over pretty quickly, or when early attrition rate is high, indicating new joiners leave the company within the first few years of employment. Therefore, it is important to ask questions, find out why people leaving, and understand what is influencing attrition rate within an organization.  

The most important question to ask is what factors are contributing to more employee attrition? Thus, by understanding these reasons for employee attrition, a company can take the correct measures to retain their employees. To explore these correlations, we used an IBM Employee Attrition dataset to explore and visualize interesting and significant factors that lead to higher employee attrition.
